# Loan-Default-Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default among applicants, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions. By analyzing historical loan data, we aim to develop a model that effectively identifies high-risk applicants, minimizing potential losses.

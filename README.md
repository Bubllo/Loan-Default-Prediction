# Loan-Default-Prediction
<hr>
This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default among applicants, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions. By analyzing historical loan data, we aim to develop a model that effectively identifies high-risk applicants, minimizing potential losses.

## Project Overview

The Loan Default Prediction project involves creating a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. This model can support financial institutions in evaluating credit risk and making decisions that optimize loan portfolio health.

  ### Key Objectives:
        1. Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
        2. Feature engineering and selection to identify significant predictors of loan default.
        3. Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to improve predictive performance.
        4. Delivering a trained model along with documentation and visualization reports.

## Key Skills and Techniques
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and balancing classes.
2. Feature Engineering: Transforming and selecting features relevant to default prediction.
3. Model Building: Training various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to identify the best-performing approach.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to enhance performance.
6. Visualization: Creating data insights and results with visualizations.

## Results
Our model achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.82, with precision and recall rates that demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-risk loan applicants. The tuned model shows reliable predictive performance in classifying applicants, providing significant insights for financial decision-making.
